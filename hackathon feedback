Reader App
First of all a very nice project ! 
I like the file structure with the routes,controllers and modules!
Nice and clean server.js.
You utilised the your database very well.
However, I would suggest that instead of looking through books for inspiration and then manually adding them in your book list-
have a button on each one of the books that adds it to your list.
Also maybe have an option to sign in so each user has their own book list and its not only for one user.
Never the less- excellent job & keep at it !
